# CEBIIT: _Bioconductor_ for integrative cancer genomic analysis

_Bioconductor_ is a widely-used collection of _R_ packages for the
statistical analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic
data. _Bioconductor_ has strengths in sequence (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq,
called variants, ...) and microarray (expression, methylation, copy
number, ...) analysis, as well as signficant facilities for flow
cytometry, proteomics, and many other 'omics domains. The breadth of
available facilities coupled with principles of interoperability and
reproducibility make _Bioconductor_ an ideal platform for integrative
approaches to cancer genomics. This presentation outlines technical
aspects of recent and forthcoming facilities to enable integrative
cancer genomic analysis in _Bioconductor_. We discussion our own work
to enable routine integrate of large-scale consortium (e.g., ENCODE,
Ensembl) annotation into analysis work flows, development within
_Bioconductor_ of facilities to manage multiple-assay experiments, and
approaches to scaling _R_'s in-memory model to large scale data
sets. The presentation concludes with a brief overview of integrative
approaches contributed to _Bioconductor_ by our international
contributors.
